- Primary action on every page should be immediately obvious
- Typography should emphasize clarity over style — clean sans-serif, generous spacing
- Color palette should feel cohesive and intentional
- Whitespace should feel purposeful, not empty

## Page: /
- Hero should immediately communicate what the company does (no ambiguity)
- Social proof (logos, testimonials) should be visible without scrolling on desktop
- CTA hierarchy: primary action should dominate, secondary should be clearly subordinate
- Page should feel focused, not cluttered

## Page: /about
- Team section should feel human and approachable
- Company story should read top-to-bottom without layout interruptions

## Page: /pricing

- Recommended tier should be visually distinct without feeling pushy
- Feature comparison should be readable without horizontal scrolling on tablet+
